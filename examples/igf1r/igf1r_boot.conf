# Demonstration of boostrapping on a model of IGF1R activation. 
# TODO: Check that this runs

# This fitting job originally appeared in Erickson et al. (currently under review), performed with BioNetFit 1. 
# The bootstrapping results are expected to be comparable to the results of Erickson et al.
