## Description
On the basis of compartmental models that reproduce Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance data, we used Bayesian inference and the next-generation matrix approach to estimate region-specific R_0 values for 280 of 384 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States (US), which account for 95% of the US population living in urban areas and 82% of the total population.

Differential contagiousness of respiratory disease across the United States. Abhishek Mallela, Yen Ting Lin, and William S. Hlavacek.

## Files
Model, data, and configuration files required to perform model parameterization for each of the 280 MSAs in PyBioNetFit

## Notes

This model was parameterized using PyBioNetFit v1.1.9

Data corresponding to population features was obtained from the following repository: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data](url)
