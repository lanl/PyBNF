PyBNF documentation
=================================

PyBNF is a tool for parameter fitting of dynamical systems biology models specified using the BioNetGen rule-based
modeling language (`BNGL`_) or the Systems Biology Markup Language (`SBML`_). It currently runs on most Linux and macOS
workstations as well as distributed computing systems using the SLURM queueing manager.
